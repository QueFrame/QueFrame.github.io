        <h1>Will's Super Duper Awesome Webpage</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my super duper duper duper super duper website.
        I'm Will, the editor and creator of many things, including this website.
    One would likely ask me to explain who I am as a person, so I shall honor the requests of my fans
    and do so. I went to Westhill Highschool, and am now majoring in Software Engineering. 
    I like listening to music, messing around with speakers and sound equipment, programming, and spending time with friends.
